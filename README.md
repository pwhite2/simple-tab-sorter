# Simple Tab Sorter

"Simple Tab Sorter" is a free and open-source Google Chrome extension for people who want quick and easy user-customizable tab sorting and grouping.

In addition to standard URL or title-based sorting, its "killer features" are:

1. Respects Google Chrome's Tab Groups.
2. User configurable sort behavior for handling tabs suspended by extensions forked from [The Great Suspender](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender).
3. Simple manual override of tab group sort order. 

### Bugs / Feature Requests

My intention is to keep this extension "Simple" and light weight. I've received feature requests that conflict with these goals and have created [Super Tab Sorter](https://github.com/pwhite2/super-tab-sorter/) with the intention of it being a feature rich version of Simple Tab Sorter. 

You should [give Super Tab Sorter a try](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/super-tab-sorter/jjhppbooocacaccnhjninhmigbfmpnkh) if you want more functionality than Simple Tab Sorter and submit feature requests in [Super Tab Sorter's issue tracker](https://github.com/pwhite2/super-tab-sorter/issues/) if it's lacking functionality you desire. Please check the **User Guide** on the Options page before doing that. Also, keep in mind that these extensions sorts tabs, they don't "manage" them. Tab management is not what I do, so look for another extension if you need that.

You can [submit bugs](https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter/issues/) if you encounter issues with this extension. Please refer to the **User Guide**, which can be found in this extension's Options page, before submitting bugs.

I can be contacted via the contact form at [peterwhite.net](https://peterwhite.net) for other inquiries.

### Install from the Chrome Web Store

Simple Tab Sorter is [available via the official Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-tab-sorter/cgfpgnepljlgenjclbekbjdlgcodfmjp).

Please note that the webstore version may lag behind the latest version found here. My intention is to limit experimentation to GitHub in an attempt to avoid being buried in support requests from the wider public audience using the Chrome Web Store.

### Install as an extension from source

1. Download and extract the **[latest available release](https://github.com/pwhite2/simple-tab-sorter/releases)**, or clone this repo (if you enjoy living on the edge), to your preferred location.
2. In any **Google Chrome** compatible browser, navigate to "chrome://extensions" and enable "Developer mode" in the upper right corner.
3. Click the <kbd>Load unpacked</kbd> button.
4. Browse to the **src** directory of the extracted folder, or cloned reop, and select or confirm (the terminology may be browser dependent).

Once you have completed the above steps, you should see the <img src="src/img/128.png" width="16px"/> icon in your browser toolbar, indicating successful installation of the extension.
