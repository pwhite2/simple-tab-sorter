                                    <h5>Important note about Chrome "Tab Groups" Support</h5>
                                    <p>Google Chrome recently introduced "Tab Groups" but it looks like this is a work in progress from an extension API perspective... I say this because a "groupId" field has been added to the Tab API but the tab group name
                                        isn't available via the extension API and I've experienced tabs being removed from tab groups while sorting even though the tab group id's remain unchanged.</p>
                                    <p><b>Simple Tab Sorter v0.3.2 is a patch that ignores tab groups and the tabs contained within them.</b> Ungrouped tabs will continue to be sorted, as they were in previous releases, but the position and contents of tab groups will remain unchanged. </p>
                                    <p>If you're using tab groups and <b>ungrouped</b> tabs aren't sorting the way you expect, I'd suggest positioning all of your tab groups to the left of your ungrouped tabs to see whether that resolves the problem. I'd like to add full
                                        support for sorting Tab Groups in the future but that will be somewhat dependent on both my available time and better Tab Group support via the Google Chome Tab API.
                                    </div>
                                    <h4>General Usage and Behavior</h4>
                                    <p>Regardless of the settings you choose, it's important to understand the following 2 things:
                                        <ol class="alert alert-primary">
                                            <li><strong>Tabs will only be sorted when Simple Tab Sorter's icon is clicked.</strong></li>
                                            <li><strong>Tabs will only be sorted in the browser window where the icon is clicked.</strong></li>
                                        </ol>  
                                        With this in mind, you can safely experiment with different sort options, without reshuffling all the tabs in your main window,
                                        by opening several tabs in a new browser window and experimenting with the sort options in that window. Please note that extension settings are global,
                                        so any setting changes you save will be applied to all open windows when you click the Simple Tab Sorter icon later.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Setting Explanations</h4>
                                    <h5>Sort By</h5>
                                    <p>You can sort by Title, URL, or Custom. Only <em>Sort by Custom</em>'s behavior is affected by the "<em>Group From</em>" and "<em>Preserve order within groups</em>"
                                    settings. <em>Sort by Title</em> and <em>Sort by URL</em> ignore those settings and sort strictly by localized page <em>Title</em> or <em>URL</em> in ascending order.
                                    All <em>Sort By</em> options support the "<em>Group suspended tabs together</em>" setting, which groups all suspended tabs to the left side of your browser window.</p>
                                    <h5>Sort pinned tabs</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Simple Tab Sorter <b>ignores</b> pinned tabs by default. If you check the box, pinned tabs will remain grouped together but will be sub-sorted by the same criteria used to sort the rest of your tabs.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Group suspended tabs together (applicable if using an extension derived from The Great Suspender)</h5>
                                    <p>Other tab sorting extensions that I've used have grouped all tabs suspended by The Great Suspender together, because The Great Suspender modifies the URL of
                                        suspended tabs and retains the original URL as a query parameter. I was a major fan of the original The Great Suspender (before the transfer of ownership), but have found that sorting behavior annoying, which was one of my primary
                                        reasons for creating Simple Tab Sorter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By default, Simple Tab Sorter <strong>will not</strong> <em>Group suspended tabs together</em> - your suspended tabs will be sorted as if they were unsuspended. If you check the box,
                                        all suspended tabs will be shifted to the far left side of your browser and maintain their relative position to each other unless "<em>Preserve order within groups</em>" is <strong>deselected</strong>,
                                        in which case the suspended tabs will be subsorted by URL.
                                    </p>
                                    <h6>Tab suspender extension id (required if "Group suspended tabs together" is unchecked)</h6>
                                    Look at the URL in your browser's address bar, for any suspended tab, and you should see something similar to the following...
                                    <div class="code">
                                        chrome-extension://<mark>klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg</mark>/suspended.html#ttl=Google&pos=0&uri=https://www.google.com/
                                    </div>
                                    <p></p>
                                    The example above shows the URL for a suspended https://www.google.com/ tab that was suspended by the original The Great Suspender extension. The highlighted  portion between
                                    <i>chrome-extension://</i> and <i>/suspended.html</i> is the "extension id" that you should copy/paste into the input field directly below "Group suspended tabs together" in the
                                    <a href="options.html">Settings</a> page - don't forget to click Save!

                                    <p></p>
                                    <p>Please note that the original The Great Suspender's extension id will appear in the "Tab suspender extension id" field (it's the default value) until you change and save the value
                                        in that field. This value can be safely ignored if you're not using The Great Suspender or an extension derived from it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p></p>
                                    <h5>Group From (<em>Sort by Custom</em> only)</h5>
                                    <p>This setting is used to determine whether the first instance of a "tab group" should be identified in order from "<em>Left to Right</em>" or "<em>Right to Left</em>".
                                        <strong>This allows people to quickly, and easily, determine their desired "tab group" order by manually rearranging only a handful of tabs before clicking on the Simple Tab Sorter icon</strong>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>While this may seem unusual, at first, I encourage you to experiment with <em>Sort by Custom</em> and this setting for a while - I think it will quickly grow on you if you're
                                        not a fan from the start.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Preserve order within groups (<em>Sort by Custom</em> only)</h5>
                                    <p>The default behavior of this extension is to preserve the pre-sorted order of tabs within the sorted tab groups. I find this preferable to sorting everything
                                        by <em>Title</em> or <em>URL</em>, but included this as an option for others who prefer to have everything sorted alphabetically. If deselected, tabs will be subsorted by URL.</p>
