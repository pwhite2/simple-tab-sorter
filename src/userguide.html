                                    <p>Thanks for taking the time to read this page. Doing so will, hopefully, save you time and improve your experience with this extension!
                                        Please refer back to this page after receiving updates because behavioral changes may be introduced as a result of any bug fixes or enhancement requests.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>General Usage and Behavior</h4>
                                    <p>Regardless of the settings you choose, it's important to understand the following 2 things:
                                        <ol class="alert alert-primary">
                                            <li><strong>Tabs will only be sorted when Simple Tab Sorter's icon is clicked.</strong></li>
                                            <li><strong>Tabs will only be sorted in the browser window where the icon is clicked.</strong></li>
                                        </ol>  
                                        With this in mind, you can safely experiment with different sort options, without reshuffling all the tabs in your main window,
                                        by opening several tabs in a new browser window and experimenting with the sort options in that window. Please note that extension settings are global,
                                        so any setting changes you save will be applied to all open windows when you click the Simple Tab Sorter icon later.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Setting Explanations</h4>
                                    <h5>Sort By</h5>
                                    <p>You can sort by Title, URL, or Custom. Only <em>Sort by Custom</em>'s behavior is affected by the "<em>Group From</em>" and "<em>Preserve order within groups</em>"
                                    settings. <em>Sort by Title</em> and <em>Sort by URL</em> ignore those settings and sort strictly by localized page <em>Title</em> or <em>URL</em> in ascending order.
                                    All <em>Sort By</em> options support the "<em>Group suspended tabs together</em>" setting, which groups all suspended tabs to the left side of your browser window.</p>
                                    <h5>Group From (<em>Sort by Custom</em> only)</h5>
                                    <p>This setting is used to determine whether the first instance of a "tab group" should be identified in order from "<em>Left to Right</em>" or "<em>Right to Left</em>".
                                        <strong>This allows people to quickly, and easily, determine their desired "tab group" order by manually rearranging only a handful of tabs before clicking on the Simple Tab Sorter icon</strong>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>While this may seem unusual, at first, I encourage you to experiment with <em>Sort by Custom</em> and this setting for a while - I think it will quickly grow on you if you're
                                        not a fan from the start.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Preserve order within groups (<em>Sort by Custom</em> only)</h5>
                                    <p>The default behavior of this extension is to preserve the pre-sorted order of tabs within the sorted tab groups. I find this preferable to sorting everything
                                        by <em>Title</em> or <em>URL</em>, but included this as an option for others who prefer to have everything sorted alphabetically. If deselected, tabs will be subsorted by URL.</p>
                                    <h5>Group suspended tabs together</h5>
                                    <p>Other tab sorting extensions that I've used have grouped all tabs suspended by The Great Suspender together, because The Great Suspender modifies the URL of
                                        suspended tabs and retains the original URL as a query parameter. I'm a big fan of The Great Suspender, but have found that sorting behavior annoying, which was one of my primary
                                        reasons for creating Simple Tab Sorter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By default, Simple Tab Sorter <strong>will not</strong> <em>Group suspended tabs together</em> - your suspended tabs will be sorted as if they were unsuspended. If you check the box,
                                        all suspended tabs will be shifted to the far left side of your browser and maintain their relative position to each other unless "<em>Preserve order within groups</em>" is <strong>deselected</strong>,
                                        in which case the suspended tabs will be subsorted by URL.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Sort pinned tabs</h5>
                                    <p>
                                        Simple Tab Sorter <b>ignores</b> pinned tabs by default. If you check the box, pinned tabs will remain grouped together but will be sub-sorted by the same criteria used to sort the rest of your tabs.
                                    </p>
