                                    <p>Thanks for taking the time to read this page. Doing so will, hopefully, save you time and improve your experience with this extension!
                                        Please refer back to this page after receiving updates because this plugin is still in the early stages of development and
                                        behavioral changes may be introduced as a result of any bug fixes or enhancement requests.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>General Usage and Behavior</h4>
                                    <p>Regardless of the settings you choose, it's important to understand the following 2 things:
                                        <ol>
                                            <li>Tabs will only be sorted when Simple Tab Sorter's icon is clicked.</li>
                                            <li>Tabs will only be sorted in the browser window where the icon is clicked.</li>
                                        </ol>  
                                        With this in mind, you can safely experiment with different sort options, without reshuffling all the tabs in your main window,
                                        by opening several tabs in a new browser window and experimenting with the sort options in that window. Please note that extension settings are global,
                                        so any setting changes you save will be applied to all open windows where you may click the Simple Tab Sorter icon.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>Setting Explanations</h4>
                                    <h5>Sort By</h5>
                                    <p>At this time, you can sort by URL or page title. <em>Sort by URL</em>'s behavior is affected by the <em>Group From</em>, <em>Preserve order within groups</em>,
                                    and <em>Group suspended tabs together</em> settings while <em>Sort by Title</em> ignores those settings and sorts strictly by localized page title in ascending order.
                                    <em>Group suspended tabs together setting</em>.</p>
                                    <h5>Group From</h5>
                                    <p>This setting is used to determine whether the first instance of a "tab group" should be identified in order from left to right or right to left. As designed, Simple Tabs Sorter
                                        does not <em>Sort by URL</em> alphabetically. It can be configured to sort alphabetically, within groups (see below), but <em>my intention was to create an extension that allows
                                        people to quickly, and easily, determine their desired "tab group" order by manually rearranging only a handful of tabs before clicking on the Simple Tab Sorter icon</em>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>While this may seem unusual, at first, I encourage you to experiment with <em>Sort by URL</em> and this setting for a while - I think it will quickly grow on you if you're
                                        not a fan from the start.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Preserve order within groups</h5>
                                    <p>The default behavior of this extension is to preserve the pre-sort order of tabs within the sorted tab groups. I find this preferable to sorting everything
                                        by URL, but included this as an option for others who prefer to have all URLs sorted alphabetically.</p>
                                    <h5>Group suspended tabs together</h5>
                                    <p>Other tab sorting extensions that I've used have grouped all tabs suspended by The Great Suspender together, because The Great Suspender modifies the URL of
                                        suspended tabs and retains the original URL as a query parameter. I'm a big fan of The Great Suspender, but have found that sorting behavior annoying, which was one of my primary
                                        reasons for creating Simple Tab Sorter.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        By default, Simple Tab Sorter <strong>will not</strong> <em>Group suspended tabs together</em> - your suspended tabs will be sorted as if they were unsuspended. If you check the box,
                                        all suspended tabs will be shifted to the far left side of your browser and maintain their relative position to each other unless <em>Preserve order within groups</em> is <strong>deselected</strong>,
                                        in which case the suspended tabs will be subsorted by URL.
                                    </p>
